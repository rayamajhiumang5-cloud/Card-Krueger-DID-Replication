**Course:** ECON 5200: Applied Econometrics

**Environment:** Python (Pandas, Statsmodels)

**Track:** Track A (Difference-in-Differences)

**Project Mission**

This study replicates the seminal research by David Card and Alan Krueger regarding the impact of the minimum wage on employment. As part of the "Credibility Revolution" in economics, this project demonstrates the shift from theoretical abstraction to rigorous empirical causal inference using real-world, "messy" data.

**Research Question**

Does an increase in the state minimum wage lead to a decrease in employment in the fast-food industry?

Using the 1992 New Jersey minimum wage increase as a natural experiment, I compare employment changes in New Jersey (Treatment Group) against Eastern Pennsylvania (Control Group) where the wage remained constant.

**Identification Strategy**

The core methodology is Difference-in-Differences (DiD). The identification relies on the "Parallel Trends" assumption—the idea that in the absence of the policy change, the employment trends in NJ and PA would have moved in tandem.
